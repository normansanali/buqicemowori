The most surefire way is to get TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) certified. There are lots of online classes, but if you want to teach in one specific country, like Costa Rica, taking a certification class in country will score you more points with future employers. We’ve listed our top TEFL Costa Rica classes here, and most will help you with job placement after as well. There are a handful of other teaching jobs abroad, from teaching English to teaching music, and we’ve listed our best from Costa Rica here. You can also keep an eye on our <a href=# rel class=link>job board</a>. A lot of the teaching abroad positions are volunteer based. You won’t earn a salary, but you will earn a life-changing experience that will open your eyes to an entirely new culture and way of life. (Plus it looks pretty great on your resume!).</p><p><strong>Here’s a sneak peak of the best programs for teaching English in Costa Rica this year:</strong></p><h2>The best programs for teaching abroad in Costa Rica this year&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> This information on ESL jobs in Costa Rica was accurate at the time of publishing.

(The fact that a glorious beach is just a 10-minute, 56-cent bus ride away didn't hurt.) And the instructor IS awesome -- Audra Wooldridge may be the best instructor I've ever been lucky enough to learn from in my life! Audra teaches TEFLers by expertly using the techniques that we'll use on our own future students, so we were able to experience first-hand how effective they are. Plus she is energetic and witty ... every day was exciting. I finished the program 1 week ago, have had 3 job interviews, and feel confident that at least 1 solid job offer will be made. If you're wondering whether the TEFL Costa Rica class is worthwhile, I say it absolutely is -- esp if you train with Audra at Maximo Nivel!” —<a href=# rel class=link>Read more Maximo Nivel reviews here</a></p><ul><li><strong>Where?</strong> Manuel Antonio and San Jose, Costa Rica</li><li><strong>When? </strong>Year-round; 4 weeks</li><li><strong>Why? </strong>The only thing better than teaching in Costa Rica is earning your TEFL certification there too!

It was so nice to know, before you were able to call your host country a home, that there were resident directors who could help you through every step of the transition to teaching English in Costa Rica. I really felt like I was able to go to them with any sort of problem or concern. API also deserves credit for their incredibly well organized excursions. I really enjoyed getting the opportunity to travel with other students in my program to discover the beauty of Costa Rica in Manuel Antonio & Rio Celeste and even taking a trip over the southern border to visit Panama City and the historical Panama Canal… I would definitely recommend this program to any student seeking a truly memorable and meaningful study abroad experience.

The program itself costs ~$750, but there is a ~$500 bonus if you complete your teaching contract. In exchange for your teaching services, about 20-30 hours a week, you’ll get room and board plus a laundry service (look great, smell great, sleep great!).

My advice is to choose Greenheart Travel. The website is very straight forward, and any other question you may have, the staff is always open to answering them in a timely matter. While abroad, they reach out to you to make sure your program is going smoothly. It is very comforting to know that the person you were in contact with before your departure still connects with you during and even after your program. My host family was amazing!

I was teaching at two middle schools for 17 hours per week. Most of the teachers that I was teaching with were really good at realizing when I needed help translating for the students or controlling unfocused energy in the classroom. TCEP provided some great materials that spring-boarded my teaching ideas while other materials were incomplete and useless. I did have many more resources than tutors that I met that had used other American agencies to travel. Living with my host family was the most rewarding part of the experience. The youngest girl in the family improved so much in English while I was there. She was my little buddy. I also had time to travel on weekends.

I wanted to experience a rich culture far from my own and make a difference there. I got all of that and more out of my experience and impact while volunteering. Did I mention that this was my 1st time teaching and my 1st time volunteering? I have to say that it couldn’t have been a better 1st-time experience! The smiles on the students faces when they learned new words, meanings, and pronunciations from our classes were amazing. The energy they displayed and the connection I was able to make with them touched my heart and confirmed that I had chosen the right volunteer program. I felt like part of the family immediately. Everyone was so incredibly supportive, great partners in the classroom, and helped me obtain some teaching skills to take back home! When my time was up, the hardest thing was saying goodbye to all of my students...and I quickly started thinking of when I would be able to come back and see them!
